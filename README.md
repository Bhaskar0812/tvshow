# TV Shows
or the coding test: We would like you to design a web application that uses the TVmaze API (http://www.tvmaze.com/api) to display a television schedule of the programs currently airing in the US. When the user selects a show, a detail screen should open that displays the shows metadata.


Although the focus will be more on your coding structure, please feel free to design the user interface to be as contemporary as you would like.

You should be able to explain the design decisions you made and what other options you considered before going with the final implementation.
